Hi, I'm Nihal!

I am a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science at Brown University. I work with with [Stephen Bach](http://stephenbach.net/) and my research focuses on zero-shot learning with explicit high-level knowledge.

Previously, I worked as a NLP Engineer at [Stride.AI](stride.ai). I have also worked with Prof. H S Jamadgani at the Indian Institute of Science ([IISc](http://www.iisc.ac.in/)) as an Intern and then briefly as a Project Assistant.

Feel free to get in touch with me.
